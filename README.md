# A-Membership-Function-Dependent-L-Performance-Based-Output-Interval-Estimation-Method

## Abstract

In the design process of traditional L∞ methods, a common performance in-
dex is often considered in different fuzzy rules. This may introduce a certain
conservatism when most of the whole fuzzy system operates under a certain
fuzzy rule or a few fuzzy rules. Therefore, this paper focuses on robust in-
terval estimation problems for discrete-time Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy systems,
and a new membership function-dependent L∞ performance index is pro-
posed. The proposed L∞ performance can ensure better results in practical
engineering applications by using the priori knowledge that the model works
most of the time on some specific fuzzy systems to design performance in-
dex. By means of fuzzy basis-dependent Lyapunov functions, a membership
function-dependent L∞ performance based interval estimation strategy ap-
plied to fault detection is presented. Through simulation analysis, the L∞
index in this paper is better than the conventional one and a tighter interval
estimation is obtained leading to more accurate and faster fault detection
effects. Meanwhile, the simulation results of this method also reflect the
membership function-dependent property well.
